rem DiscWright Windows app - Final build (v39).
rem
rem Usage (cmd or PowerShell, from anywhere):
rem   build-app.cmd
rem Prepares the encoder tools (tools\ - see the tools stage
rem below), builds the WinUI 3 app with Visual Studio's MSBuild
rem (Release, x64, unpackaged + self-contained), and copies
rem the runnable output plus the tools into DiscWright\ next
rem to this script. After the folder, the script ALSO
rem produces DiscWright-standalone.exe next to this script -
rem one file, double-click to run, no install (it unpacks
rem itself under %LOCALAPPDATA%\DiscWright on first run; see
rem launcher\launcher.cpp). The folder build stays for
rem debugging.
rem Run it by double-clicking DiscWright\DiscWright.exe - the
rem folder carries its own Windows App SDK + .NET runtime.
rem Every path is quoted: build folders may contain spaces.
rem The first build restores NuGet packages (Windows App SDK,
rem Win2D) and needs network access.

rem Build with Visual Studio's MSBuild, NOT "dotnet build": the Windows
rem App SDK's PRI/AppX build tasks (Microsoft.Build.Packaging.Pri.Tasks.dll,
rem Microsoft.Build.AppxPackage.dll) ship with Visual Studio's MSBuild
rem only, never with the standalone .NET SDK, and "dotnet build" dies
rem with MSB4062 looking for them under the SDK's folders. VS's MSBuild
rem finds them in its own folders natively. (Switched 2026-11-06, v20.)

rem ============================================================
rem Step 3 tools stage: the encoder's tools, prepared BEFORE
rem MSBuild and copied beside the exe afterwards. Everything
rem is cached by presence/stamps under tools\ - only a first
rem run pays the pinned downloads (ffmpeg, libsndfile, and
rem CMake when the machine has none) and the atracdenc compile.
rem
rem v27: vcpkg is GONE from this script. v26 hunted for the
rem vcpkg bundled with Visual Studio and stopped dead on
rem Lola's machine - it is a separate VS component her
rem install does not carry, and no build should hinge on it.
rem libsndfile now arrives the same way ffmpeg does: the
rem project's OFFICIAL prebuilt win64 zip, pinned by URL +
rem SHA-256 (verified from the real archive: sndfile.h,
rem sndfile.lib, a self-contained sndfile.dll, and a CMake
rem config package - everything atracdenc's build needs).

rem lesson as vcpkg in v26. This script now leans on VS ONLY
rem for MSBuild and the MSVC compiler, which the app build
rem genuinely needs; every other tool is a pinned download.) ----

rem ============================================================
rem Standalone stage (v32; hardened in v34): pack the
rem DiscWright\ folder into ONE double-clickable file -
rem DiscWright-standalone.exe = [launcher PE][payload.zip]
rem [48-byte footer]. The launcher (launcher\launcher.cpp)
rem unpacks the folder per-user under %LOCALAPPDATA%\DiscWright
rem on first run and starts the app: no install, no admin.
rem WinUI 3 has no true single-file publishing, so this
rem bootstrapper is the single-file form.
rem
rem v34: the launcher is hardened so a standalone that does
rem not run TESTIFIES instead of dying silently (which is
rem what v32's did on Lola's machine): named-stage errors
rem S1-S11 with Win32 codes, a payload self-check against
rem the footer, unpack.log in the unpack folder, and a
rem watch console narrating the first run live. This stage
rem testifies too: every exit below sets STANDALONE_FAIL,
rem and the final summary prints a STANDALONE RESULT verdict
rem (OK, or SKIPPED - <stage>) that cannot scroll by unnoticed.
rem
rem The standalone is an EXTRA, never a gate: a machine
rem without the MSVC C++ toolset still produces the proven
rem folder build, and this stage just warns and skips.
