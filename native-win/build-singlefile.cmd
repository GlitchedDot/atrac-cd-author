rem DiscWright Windows app - native single-file publish (v33).
rem
rem Usage (cmd or PowerShell, from anywhere):
rem   build-singlefile.cmd
rem Publishes the WinUI 3 app as ONE file -
rem DiscWright-singlefile.exe next to this script - using
rem Microsoft's own PublishSingleFile for unpackaged
rem self-contained WinUI 3 apps (supported since Windows
rem App SDK 1.5; the build target
rem WindowsAppSDKSingleFileVerifyConfiguration checks the
rem configuration as it goes). The exe is not zero-file at
rem runtime: it extracts its dependencies to a temp dir at
rem first launch and runs from there.
rem
rem This is an ALTERNATIVE to build-app.cmd, not a
rem replacement: build-app.cmd (v32) builds the runnable
rem folder AND wraps it in DiscWright-standalone.exe via the
rem custom launcher - also one double-clickable file. Both
rem routes stand on their own; build-app.cmd is UNTOUCHED by
rem this script and remains the fallback if the native
rem publish misbehaves on a given machine.
rem
rem This script layers on the SAME prepared encoder tools
rem build-app.cmd's tools stage produces under tools\ - it
rem does NOT prepare them itself. Run build-app.cmd once
rem first; if tools\ffmpeg.exe, tools\atracdenc.exe or
rem tools\sndfile.dll is missing, this script stops and says
rem so before anything is built.
rem Every path is quoted: build folders may contain spaces.

rem Build with Visual Studio's MSBuild, NOT the "dotnet"
rem command: the Windows App SDK's PRI/AppX build tasks
rem (Microsoft.Build.Packaging.Pri.Tasks.dll,
rem Microsoft.Build.AppxPackage.dll) ship with Visual Studio's
rem MSBuild only, never with the standalone .NET SDK, and a
rem publish driven from the SDK's own MSBuild dies with
rem MSB4062 looking for them under the SDK's folders. VS's
rem MSBuild finds them in its own folders natively.

rem ============================================================
rem The encoder tools, checked BEFORE MSBuild: the v33
rem csproj items link these three files from tools\ into the
rem publish as loose content (the app's EncodeService looks
rem for them under ^<base^>\tools\ at runtime). If they are
rem not project content, the single-file bundle silently
rem omits them and every encode fails "ffmpeg was not
rem found" - so their absence stops the publish here, with
rem the fix named, instead of shipping a quietly broken exe.
rem build-app.cmd's tools stage prepares all three.
